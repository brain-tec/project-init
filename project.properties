# This is the central configuration file of the Project Init system.
# It can contain configuration options for adjusting the general system
# behaviour itself, as well as settings applied on all newly created projects
# and settings applied only for projects using a certain programming language.
# The properties in this particular file represent the system's default
# configuration. The value of any configuration key listed here can be
# overridden by an addons resource and a user-specific configuration file.
# This works as follows: After the system has loaded the content of this file,
# it will look for a 'project.properties' file in the root of the addons
# resource directory (if applicable). If such a file exists, it is subsequently
# loaded and any redefined property is overridden. Lastly, the system will
# look for a 'project.properties' file in the user's home directory. Again,
# if such a file exists, it is loaded and any redefined properties are
# overridden for the underlying user, even when they were previously
# redefined by an addons resource.
