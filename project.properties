# This is the central configuration file of the Project Init system.
# It can contain configuration options for adjusting the general system
# behaviour itself, as well as settings applied on all newly created projects
# and settings applied only for projects using a certain programming language.
# The properties in this particular file represent the system's default
# configuration. The value of any configuration key listed here can be
# overridden by an addons resource and a user-specific configuration file.
# This works as follows: After the system has loaded the content of this file,
# it will look for a 'project.properties' file in the root of the addons
# resource directory (if applicable). If such a file exists, it is subsequently
# loaded and any redefined property is overridden. Lastly, the system will
# look for a 'project.properties' file in the user's home directory. Again,
# if such a file exists, it is loaded and any redefined properties are
# overridden for the underlying user, even when they were previously
# redefined by an addons resource.

# The name of the organisation. This is also used in copyright headers
project.organisation.name=Raven Computing

# of the organsiation

# The e-mail address of the organisation

# The example slogan string to use in different places of base project types.
# Keep it short. This is used e.g. by default generated code for the text
# printed by an application when creating an executable project
project.slogan.string=Created by Project Init system

# The name of a new project. Can be set to give every initialized project the
# same initial name. When set to 'ask' (the default), the user will be prompted
# by a form question to enter the name for a new project.
project.name=ask

# The description of a new project. Can be set to give every initialized
# project the same initial description. When set to 'ask' (the default), the

# a new project.

# does not provide a short description in the main form

# The license of a new project. Can be set to give every initialized project
# the same license. When set to 'ask' (the default), the user will be prompted
# by a form question to enter the license for a new project. Otherwise, the
# specified value of this property must match the name of an available license,
# e.g. 'Apache License 2.0' will result in every new initialized project to
# have the corresponding Apache license.
project.license=ask

# --------------------------- System Configuration -------------------------- #

# If this is set to true, then a new project is initialized in the
# current working directory when Project Init is run.
# If this is set to false, then a new project is initialized relative
# to the user's home directory as specified
# by 'sys.project.workdir.base' (see below).
# This configuration only affects the suggested default path to the
# project directory. The user is still asked the corresponding form question.
sys.project.workdir.cwd=false

# The directory under which new software projects are initialized.
# This is relative to the user's home directory. This configuration only
# affects the suggested default path to the project directory. The user

# If this is set to true, then the system will ask for a final
# confirmation before initializing the project.

# Set this to true to avoid loading the quickstart functions provided by
# the base resources of the system. This property can be used by addons to
# make only their quickstart functions available to the user.
sys.quickstart.base.disable=false

# If this is set to true, the any usage of API functions, behaviour or
# features which have been marked as deprecated will trigger a warning shown
# to the user. Set this to false to disable all kinds of deprecation warnings.
sys.warn.deprecation=true

# If this is set to true, then the list item number entered by the
# user in form selections is substituted to the corresponding list item
# name string as soon as the user hits enter.

# If this is set to true, then the input entered by the
# user in yes-no form questions is substituted to the corresponding

# If this is set to true, then the system will play the bell alert
# sound in the case of a failure.

# Specifies whether hyperlinks are embedded into the corresponding terminal
# escape codes. If this is set to true, then hyperlinks are shown by their
# clickable label. Otherwise, if this is set to false, hyperlinks are printed
# with their normal unescaped URL text. This might still be clickable depending
# on the used terminal emulator, but is potentially a much longer text. Please
# note that not all terminal emulators support the underlying escape codes.
# If you experience troubles with the display of hyperlinks,
# we recommend setting this property to false.
sys.output.hyperlinks.escape=true

# If this is set to true, then any missing system dependencies will result
# in a failure. If this is set to false, then only a warning is displayed
# in such a case. This property has only an effect for system dependencies
# declared by addons resources.

# Enable/disable the start title
sys.starttitle.show=true
