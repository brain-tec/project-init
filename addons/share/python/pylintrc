[MASTER]

# This is an example of how your addon can overwrite a shared template
# resource file. The original file is located in the source root of
# Project Init under 'share/python/pylintrc'. By placing your 'pylintrc'
# file under the same directory hierarchy in your addon, your custom
# pylintrc will take precedence over the original for all initialized
# projects which use that shared file.
