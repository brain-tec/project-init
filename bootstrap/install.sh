# This script is used to install/uninstall the Project Init script on a host system.
# Installation will only copy the run.sh script to an appropriate location to
# allow bootstrapping the Project Init system's latest version on demand.
# This script may also be used to uninstall the run.sh script from
# a host system by using the '--uninstall' option. By default, the user has to
# confirm the (un)installation. This can be circumvented by using
# the '--yes' option.
# The place in the filesystem where the Project Init system will be installed is
# determined by the effective user ID when running this script. When this script
# is executed by the root user, the Project Init system will be installed in a
# system-wide location, otherwise it will be installed in a user-wide location.
# This script will have an exit status of 0 if the (un)installation was
# executed successfully. Otherwise, the exit status will be non-zero.
