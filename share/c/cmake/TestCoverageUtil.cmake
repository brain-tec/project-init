#
# Contains a function for adding compiler options to targets in CMake-based
# projects to add support for code test coverage instrumentation.
# The minimum CMake version required by this code is v3.14.
#
#==============================================================================

# Adds code test coverage support to a given CMake target.
#
# Appends the appropriate compiler flags to enable code test
# coverage instrumentation for the specified target.
# Code coverage should only be enabled for Debug builds.
#
# Arguments:
#
#   target_name:
#       The name of the target to which code coverage support will be added.
#       This argument is mandatory.
#
# Example:
#   add_code_coverage(mytarget)
#
function(add_code_coverage target_name)
