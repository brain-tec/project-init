# Doxyfile 1.10.0

# This file describes the settings to be used by the documentation system
# doxygen (www.doxygen.org) for a project.
#
# All text after a double hash (##) is considered a comment and is placed in
# front of the TAG it is preceding.
#
# All text after a single hash (#) is considered a comment and will be ignored.
# The format is:
# TAG = value [value, ...]
# For lists, items can also be appended using:
# TAG += value [value, ...]
# Values that contain spaces should be placed between quotes (\" \").

# Project related configuration options
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# This tag specifies the encoding used for all characters in the configuration
# file that follow. The default is UTF-8 which is also the encoding used for all
# text before the first occurrence of this tag. Doxygen uses libiconv (or the
# iconv built into libc) for the transcoding. See
# https://www.gnu.org/software/libiconv/ for the list of possible encodings.
# The default value is: UTF-8.

DOXYFILE_ENCODING      = UTF-8

# The PROJECT_NAME tag is a single word (or a sequence of words surrounded by
# double-quotes, unless you are using Doxywizard) that should identify the
# project for which the documentation is generated. This name is used in the
# title of most generated pages and in a few other places.
# The default value is: My Project.

# This tag implements a quasi-intelligent brief description abbreviator that is
# used to form the text in various listings. Each string in this list, if found
# as the leading text of the brief description, will be stripped from the text
# and the result, after processing the whole list, is used as the annotated
# text. Otherwise, the brief description is used as-is. If left blank, the

# Configuration options related to the input files
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The INPUT tag is used to specify the files and/or directories that contain
# documented source files. You may enter file names like myfile.cpp or
# directories like /usr/src/myproject. Separate the files or directories with
# spaces. See also FILE_PATTERNS and EXTENSION_MAPPING
# Note: If this tag is empty the current directory is searched.

INPUT                  = src/main/include docs

# This tag can be used to specify the character encoding of the source files
# that doxygen parses. Internally doxygen uses the UTF-8 encoding. Doxygen uses
# libiconv (or the iconv built into libc) for the transcoding. See the libiconv
# documentation (see: https://www.gnu.org/software/libiconv/) for the list of
# possible encodings.
# The default value is: UTF-8.

INPUT_ENCODING         = UTF-8

# If the value of the INPUT tag contains directories, you can use the

# *.h) to filter out the source-files in the directories.
#
# Note that for custom extensions or not directly supported extensions you also
# need to set EXTENSION_MAPPING for the extension otherwise the files are not
# read by doxygen.

# The default directory is: html.
# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_HTML is set to YES.

HTML_OUTPUT            = html

# The HTML_HEADER tag can be used to specify a user-defined HTML header file for
# each generated HTML page. If the tag is left blank doxygen will generate a
# standard header.
#
# To get valid HTML the header file that includes any scripts and style sheets
# that doxygen needs, which is dependent on the configuration options used (e.g.
# the setting GENERATE_TREEVIEW). It is highly recommended to start with a
# default header using
# doxygen -w html new_header.html new_footer.html new_stylesheet.css
# YourConfigFile
# and then modify the file new_header.html. See also section "Doxygen usage"
# for information on how to generate the default header that doxygen normally
# uses.
# Note: The header is subject to change so you typically have to regenerate the
# default header when upgrading to a newer version of doxygen. For a description
# of the possible markers and block names see the documentation.
# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_HTML is set to YES.

HTML_HEADER            = 

# The HTML_FOOTER tag can be used to specify a user-defined HTML footer for each
# generated HTML page. If the tag is left blank doxygen will generate a standard
# footer. See HTML_HEADER for more information on how to generate a default
# footer and what special commands can be used inside the footer. See also
# section "Doxygen usage" for information on how to generate the default footer
# that doxygen normally uses.
# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_HTML is set to YES.

HTML_FOOTER            = 

# The HTML_EXTRA_STYLESHEET tag can be used to specify additional user-defined
# cascading style sheets that are included after the standard style sheets
# created by doxygen. Using this option one can overrule certain style aspects.
# This is preferred over using HTML_STYLESHEET since it does not replace the
# standard style sheet and is therefore more robust against future updates.
# Doxygen will copy the style sheet files to the output directory.
# Note: The order of the extra style sheet files is of importance (e.g. the last
# style sheet in the list overrules the setting of the previous ones in the
# list). For an example see the documentation.
# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_HTML is set to YES.

HTML_EXTRA_STYLESHEET  = 

# The HTML_COLORSTYLE_HUE tag controls the color of the HTML output. Doxygen
# will adjust the colors in the style sheet and background images according to
# this color. Hue is specified as an angle on a color-wheel, see
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hue for more information. For instance the value
# 0 represents red, 60 is yellow, 120 is green, 180 is cyan, 240 is blue, 300
# purple, and 360 is red again.
# Minimum value: 0, maximum value: 359, default value: 220.
# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_HTML is set to YES.

HTML_COLORSTYLE_HUE    = 220

# The HTML_COLORSTYLE_SAT tag controls the purity (or saturation) of the colors
# in the HTML output. For a value of 0 the output will use gray-scales only. A
# value of 255 will produce the most vivid colors.
# Minimum value: 0, maximum value: 255, default value: 100.
# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_HTML is set to YES.

HTML_COLORSTYLE_SAT    = 100

# The HTML_COLORSTYLE_GAMMA tag controls the gamma correction applied to the
# luminance component of the colors in the HTML output. Values below 100
# gradually make the output lighter, whereas values above 100 make the output
# darker. The value divided by 100 is the actual gamma applied, so 80 represents
# a gamma of 0.8, The value 220 represents a gamma of 2.2, and 100 does not
# change the gamma.

# If you want full control over the layout of the generated HTML pages it might
# be necessary to disable the index and replace it with your own. The
# DISABLE_INDEX tag can be used to turn on/off the condensed index (tabs) at top
# of each HTML page. A value of NO enables the index and the value YES disables
# it. Since the tabs in the index contain the same information as the navigation
# tree, you can set this option to YES if you also set GENERATE_TREEVIEW to YES.
# The default value is: NO.
# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_HTML is set to YES.

DISABLE_INDEX          = NO

# The GENERATE_TREEVIEW tag is used to specify whether a tree-like index
# structure should be generated to display hierarchical information. If the tag
# value is set to YES, a side panel will be generated containing a tree-like
# index structure (just like the one that is generated for HTML Help). For this
# to work a browser that supports JavaScript, DHTML, CSS and frames is required
# (i.e. any modern browser). Windows users are probably better off using the
# HTML help feature. Via custom style sheets (see HTML_EXTRA_STYLESHEET) one can
# further fine tune the look of the index (see "Fine-tuning the output"). As an
# example, the default style sheet generated by doxygen has an example that
# shows how to put an image at the root of the tree instead of the PROJECT_NAME.
# Since the tree basically has the same information as the tab index, you could
# consider setting DISABLE_INDEX to YES when enabling this option.
# The default value is: NO.
# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_HTML is set to YES.

GENERATE_TREEVIEW      = YES

# When the SEARCHENGINE tag is enabled doxygen will generate a search box for
# the HTML output. The underlying search engine uses javascript and DHTML and
# should work on any modern browser. Note that when using HTML help
# (GENERATE_HTMLHELP), Qt help (GENERATE_QHP), or docsets (GENERATE_DOCSET)
# there is already a search function so this one should typically be disabled.
# For large projects the javascript based search engine can be slow, then
# enabling SERVER_BASED_SEARCH may provide a better solution. It is possible to
# search using the keyboard; to jump to the search box use <access key> + S
# (what the <access key> is depends on the OS and browser, but it is typically
# <CTRL>, <ALT>/<option>, or both). Inside the search box use the <cursor down
# key> to jump into the search results window, the results can be navigated
# using the <cursor keys>. Press <Enter> to select an item or <escape> to cancel
# the search. The filter options can be selected when the cursor is inside the
# search box by pressing <Shift>+<cursor down>. Also here use the <cursor keys>
# to select a filter and <Enter> or <escape> to activate or cancel the filter
# option.
